            <h2 class="title">Equity Market Analysis</h2>

            <div class="Introduction">
                Equity Market, or stock market, is one of biggest focus for investors
                and traders. They invest in ETF, trade individual stocks, or simply talk
                baout them for fun. As a trader myself, I thought it would be fun
                to do some basic analysis of the few most famous stocks, so people who like
                to study a little bit about the market can have a general idea of what's going on.

                    Starting from selecting compnies, I listed out few stocks that you might have heard it
                    somewhere since they are so popular, and I will first show you their historical prices
                    to start off the analysis. The time was cut from 2018 to 2023 today, and each price represents the adjusted
                    market closing price, or the cost of buying a share. The buttons below allows you to choose the stocks you like,
                    and it will automatically update the prices. Also if you brush over the range you are curious about,
                    it will tells you the highest and lowest price in that range, displaying at the upper right corner.

                What you may noticed in the first place is that the price for most companies has gone up since 2018. Taking
                Microsoft as an example, the price was at ultimate low on March 2018 (green pont), and it had reached
                340 dollars at the end of 2021, which almost quadrupled. The reason is that having a large Capital allows these
                 companies to invest in more projects, develop more products, and thus generate more revenue and profits. 
                 The chart below scratchs their market values, and we can take a look of why they perform so well. 
                 Microsoft, for instance, has almost 1900 billions market cap, which can be larger than most of the other
                 stocks summing up together. If you want to get a clear picture of ordering, you can rank their capitals
                 using the button below.

                Then, you might wonder, if these companies performed outstanding in the past few years. Are there specific
                stats that allow us to evaluate the companies, such as how much could I gain if I invest in few of them. 
                Matter of fact, before you invest in any of these companies, you should notice first that
                each companies can be categorized into different sectors, and when a sector is having its peak,
                the companies in that sector will also perform well.

            <div id="p3_2"> As this graph depicted, Suppose you equally diversified your portfolio into three stocks: Apple, Microsoft
                and Tesla five years ago, your accumulated log return would be around 4.5 times of the deposit. That is a total
                of 50 percent increase on the initial investment for the past five years if you were into the Technology sector.

                Attractive as that return sounds like, most of these companies blend in our life and we interact with them
                quite ofently. If we look at the geographic graph below, we see that most of these companies' headquarters 
                are located in some of the most popular and crowded states in the United States. For example, if you hover
                over California, you will discover that most big tech companies that we selected set your headquarters over there. 
                Therefore, getting a sense of the atmosphere of these companies and gaining an insight of their current status are within easy reach.

                    So all the information so far make you curious and you like to make your own first trade, you can, and you should, 
                    check out the relative performance of each company to the market as a whole (IXIC) to pick your first stock. As depicted
                    by the diagram, companies such as Tesla and Apple show huge outperfoamnce compared to other stocks in the past, and they are getting more attention 
                    from the investors and funds. Meanwhile, J.P Morgan and Amazon did not perform as well as the others,
                    so you might want to investigate more before making a decision.

                        Among all, stock market is a great place to invest your money. However, the risk associated with it 
                        has not yet been discussed. In real cases, we can rarely conclude the future with historical data unless
                        we conducted rigorous analysis. With That being siad, the views above do not constitute investment advice and should not be relied on when making investment.
                        But, I do wish you good luck in your investment journey.
